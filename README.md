## About Project
The task was to match a static comp provided, with creative freedom of images, color, icons, and font.

 I took my love of golf and went golf themed! Caddy is meant to allow a user to keep track of score cards, and the clubs they use per each hole. The page I built the static comp on, is an overview of each course that has been played.

### Functionality
- Navigation Bar: Allows user to toggle between the course collection they have played, their bag, and their current score card.
- Courses: the `golf cart` button allows a user to start a new game at that court, this way all of the past round information is carried over. the `share` button will allow you to share with other users or friends - course location, your best score, or an invite to use a score card.

### Mobile Responsiveness

### Future Functionality
#### Score Card
- GPS location on scorecard to recognize which hole a user is on, and track distance from pin
- Track stroke counts, and what club used in bag
- Game Functionality, rule book, and golf cart compatibility

#### Bag
- Allow user to add clubs, putters, etc to their bag... This way the caddy knows exactly what clubs the user has, can recommend clubs, and keep a swing count on all clubs.
- Swing Count - Assess clubs age, and amount of swings, recommends care when needed (re-grip or new purchase)
- Add/Sell advertisements for similar clubs and gold companies, including direct links to sponsors pages
- Average Distance - Shows the average drive distance per each club.
- Footer - Direct buttons to purchase golfballs, tees, and other needs (thumbnails can be specified in settings)
